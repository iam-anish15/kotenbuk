# 🌸 Kotenbuk – Hyouka Anime Fan Website  

A beautiful fan-made tribute site dedicated to the anime **Hyouka** by Kyoto Animation.  
This website offers detailed character profiles, episode summaries with ratings, a timeline of events, a fan art gallery, and a lightweight community forum — all wrapped in a mystery-themed aesthetic that mirrors the show’s charm.  

💡 **Note:** This was a **group project**, and my key contributions were:
- 📌 **Timeline Page**
- 📌 **Character Profiles**
- 📌 **Homepage**
- 📌 **Responsiveness**
